## Splitting Nicely

Focus allows you to split windows to tiled windows nicely and sized according to the golden ratio

To get this view you would press the key combination 2 times.

**Split nicely with `<C-L>`**

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<c-l>', ':FocusSplitNicely<CR>', { silent = true })
-- Or use lua-style keymap
--vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<c-l>', ":lua require('focus').split_nicely()<CR>", { silent = true })
```

‚ùó **NOTE** ‚ùó

Additionally you can open a file or a run a custom command with the `:FocusSplitNicely` command

*Opens a file in the split created by SplitNicely command*

`:FocusSplitNicely README.md`

*Opens a terminal window in the split created by SplitNicely command by using the cmd arg to run a custom command*

`:FocusSplitNicely cmd term`



## Auto Splitting Directionally

Instead of worrying about multiple commands and shortcuts, *simply think about splits as to which direction you would like to go*.

Calling a focus split command i.e :FocusSplitRight will do one of two things, **it will attempt to move across to the window** in the specified direction.
Otherwise, **if no window exists in the specified direction** relative to the current window **then it will instead create a new blank buffer window** in the direction specified,
and then move to that window.

*Recommended commands, leverage hjkl to move and create your splits directionally with ease*
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>h', ':FocusSplitLeft<CR>', { silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>j', ':FocusSplitDown<CR>', { silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>k', ':FocusSplitUp<CR>', { silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>l', ':FocusSplitRight<CR>', { silent = true })
```
**If you lazy load this plugin with packer `module` option, please use lua-style keymap**
```lua
local focusmap = function(direction)
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<Leader>'..direction, ":lua require'focus'.split_command('"..direction.."')<CR>", { silent = true })
end
-- Use `<Leader>h` to split the screen to the left, same as command FocusSplitLeft etc
focusmap('h')
focusmap('j')
focusmap('k')
focusmap('l')
```

‚ùó **NOTE** ‚ùó

Additionally you can open a file or a run a custom command with the `:FocusSplit<direction>` command

*Opens a file in a split that was either created or moved to*

`:FocusSplitRight README.md`

*Opening a terminal window by using the cmd arg to run a custom command in a split that was created or moved to*

`:FocusSplitDown cmd term`

## Planned Improvements üòº

- [x] Refactoring
- [x] Adding more filetype support as we go
- [x] Adding Auto Line Numbers, options for relative, norelative
- [x] Adding a FocusSplitCycle command, create split if there are none, else cycle, choice between vsplit or split as default
- [x] Adding SplitCycleReverse, so we can auto-create split on left instead of right and cycle backwards
- [x] Switch back to setting height/width manually. Using vim.o.winwidth and wim.o.winminwidth was not flexible enough.

# FAQ

**I have a small display and I am finding splits are resized too much**

If for example your screen resolution is *1024x768* --> i.e on the smaller side, you may notice that focus by default can maximise a window *too much*.

That is, the window will sort of 'crush' some of your other splits due to the limited screen real estate. This is not an issue with focus,

but an issue with minimal screen real estate. In this case, you can simply reduce the width/height of focus.


**Quickfix window opens in the right split always. Is this caused by focus.lua?**

No. This is a [documented](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#quickfix) design decision by core vim, this might be something that can be adjusted upstream.

In the meantime, you can open a quickfix window occupying the the full width of the window with `:botright copen`

**I tried to lazy load focus with `:FocusToggle`, but I need to toggle it again to get auto-resizing working**

Please note if you lazy load with command `:FocusToggle`, it will load focus, but will toggle it off initially. See [#34](https://github.com/beauwilliams/focus.nvim/issues/34).

This is because focus is toggled on by default when you load focus, so if you load it and then run the command `:FocusToggle`, it toggles it off again.

**My terminal window is being resized despite 'term' filetype being ignored**

This is an issue with how and when the filetype is set for a buffer. It is recommended to use [toggleterm](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim)

And set excluded filetypes to include toggleterm e.g.. `excluded_filetypes = { 'fterm', 'term', 'toggleterm' }`
